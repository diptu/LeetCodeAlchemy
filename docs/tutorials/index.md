## Topic-Wise Problems

This repository is organized into directories based on common data structures and algorithmic techniques encountered in LeetCode problems. Here's a breakdown of each topic:

* **Arrays:**
    * Problems involving the manipulation, searching, and sorting of arrays. These problems often focus on efficient traversal and modification of array elements.
* **Linked Lists:**
    * Problems related to linked list data structures, including operations like insertion, deletion, reversal, and cycle detection.
* **Trees:**
    * Problems involving tree-based data structures, such as binary trees, n-ary trees, and binary search trees. These problems often involve tree traversal, searching, and manipulation.
* **Graphs:**
    * Problems involving graph algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), shortest paths, and connectivity.
* **Dynamic Programming:**
    * Problems that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques, which involve breaking down complex problems into overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions.
* **Sorting and Searching:**
    * Problems focused on sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).
* **Strings:**
    * Problems related to string manipulation, including pattern matching, string reversal, and substring searching.
* [**Hash Tables:**](./hashtable/index.md)
    * Problems that utilize hash tables (dictionaries or maps) to efficiently store and retrieve data.
* **Stacks and Queues:**
    * Problems that utilize stacks and queues for data storage and retrieval, often involving scenarios like expression evaluation or task scheduling.
* **Backtracking:**
    * Problems that utilize backtracking, a recursive algorithmic technique used for solving problems that involve exploring all possible solutions.
