# Problem

- [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)`Medium`

## Intuition:

**Problem:** Given an array `nums`, you need to produce a new array where each element is the product of all other elements in nums, excluding the element at that index.

**The Challenge:**

The obvious approach (multiplying all elements and dividing by the current element) has a problem: it doesn't work when `nums` contains zeros or `nums` contation large number where multiplication result doesn't contains in int range. We need a robust solution.

**The Insight:** Breaking Down the Problem

Instead of trying to calculate the product directly for each element, we can break it down into two simpler sub-problems:

**Products to the Left:** For each element, calculate the product of all elements to its left.
**Products to the Right:** For each element, calculate the product of all elements to its right.

```plain
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

# Intuition: Product of Array Except Self

**Problem:** Given an array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Naive Approach (and Why It's Inefficient):**

* A simple way is to iterate through `nums`, and for each element, calculate the product of all other elements. This would involve nested loops, leading to $O(n^2)$ time complexity.

**Efficient Approach (Using Prefix and Suffix Products):**

The key is to avoid redundant multiplications. We can do this by pre-calculating prefix and suffix products.

1.  **Left-to-Right Products (Prefix Products):**
    * Create an array `left_to_right` of the same size as `nums`.
    * `left_to_right[i]` will store the product of all elements to the *left* of `nums[i]`.
    * Initialize `left_to_right[0]` to 1 (because there are no elements to the left of the first element).
    * Iterate from left to right, calculating the prefix product at each step.

2.  **Right-to-Left Products (Suffix Products):**
    * Create an array `right_to_left` of the same size as `nums`.
    * `right_to_left[i]` will store the product of all elements to the *right* of `nums[i]`.
    * Initialize `right_to_left[size - 1]` to 1 (because there are no elements to the right of the last element).
    * Iterate from right to left, calculating the suffix product at each step.

3.  **Calculate the Result:**
    * Iterate through `nums` once more.
    * For each element `nums[i]`, the product of all elements except itself is simply `left_to_right[i] * right_to_left[i]`.
    * Store this product in the `left_to_right` array (which will be our final result).

**Why This Works:**

* **Prefix Products:** By calculating prefix products, we avoid repeatedly multiplying elements to the left of each `nums[i]`.
* **Suffix Products:** Similarly, suffix products avoid redundant multiplications for elements to the right.
* **Combining Products:** Multiplying the left and right products gives us the desired result without including `nums[i]` in the calculation.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's say `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

1.  `left_to_right` will be `[1, 1, 2, 6]`.
2.  `right_to_left` will be `[24, 12, 4, 1]`.
3.  The final result will be `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

    * `i = 2`: `result[2] = left_products[2] * right_products[2] = 2 * 4 = 8`
    * `i = 3`: `result[3] = left_products[3] * right_products[3] = 6 * 1 = 6`
    * `result` becomes `[24, 12, 8, 6]`

5.  **Return `result`:**
